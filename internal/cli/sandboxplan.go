// sandboxPlan is the launch's single resolved answer to "which sandbox is
// this run using?" — it carries BOTH of omac's confusingly similar
// "sandbox profile" namespaces side by side, resolved once:
//
//	launcher profile  a templated argv, keyed by the names in
//	                  config.SandboxConfig.Profiles ("builtin"), selected
//	                  by --sandbox / sandbox.default_profile;
//	policy profile    the grant JSON at ~/.config/omac/sandbox-profiles/
//	                  <ref>.json ("default"), spelled INSIDE the launcher
//	                  profile's command template.
//
// Both are plain strings, so before #173 nothing stopped a launcher name
// from being handed to the policy resolver — which is exactly what the
// facade wiring did, silently disabling GET /sandbox/denied on every
// default launch. Consumers now take the plan, so the mix-up cannot be
// expressed.

	Known bool
	// Native reports whether the launcher execs omac's own supervisor
	// (`{{self}} sandbox run …`) — the only backend whose policy omac can
	// inspect and whose launch-injected flags (--allow-env, …) it defines.
	Native bool
	// PolicyRef is the policy reference the launcher template passes to
	// `omac sandbox run --profile`; "" when !Native.

	// itself), but facade features derived from the policy are disabled.

// (empty means sandbox.default_profile) and, when that launcher is omac's
// native sandbox, its policy profile — read-only, so inspecting a profile
// never scaffolds files. Resolution is cheap (one file read plus path
// expansion; the full grant resolution happens inside the `omac sandbox
// run` child), so it is done once per launch and shared.
//
// An unknown launcher name is returned as an error alongside a plan with
// Name set and Known false: callers decide whether that is fatal (it is
// not under --no-sandbox / --no-inner, where no sandbox is launched).
